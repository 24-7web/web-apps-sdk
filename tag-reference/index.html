<h1>Layout reference</h1><p>You can customize the functionality and appearance of modules by editing their corresponding layouts. To make it easier to understand the concept, layouts are for modules what templates are for webpages.</p><p>Each individual module is rendered using one or in some cases more layouts.</p><h1>Using tags</h1><p>Tags are used inside Module templates or layouts and represent data associated to a module, for example the "News" module can be rendered using 2 different layouts:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you are viewing the list of news items you will be using the <a href="http://developers.businesscatalyst.com/reference/tag-reference/news/news-list-layout.html" target="_blank">"List" layout</a> which has a set of tags like {tag_subject} which outputs a hyperlink that takes you to the detail view, {<span>tag_eventfromdate</span>} which outputs the start date of the event</li>  <li>When you are viewing the news item itself the system will use the <a href="http://developers.businesscatalyst.com/reference/tag-reference/news/news-detail-layout.html" target="_blank">"Detail" layout</a> which has its own set of possible tags.</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-info"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Tags are not transferrable, and cannot be shared across all modules. Each module has its own layouts which can contain only their own tags.</p></div><p>Here is the <a href="http://developers.businesscatalyst.com/reference/tag-reference/index.html">list of tags</a> you can use groupped by module and layout.</p></div></div></div>
