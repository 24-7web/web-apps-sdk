## Tag reference

You can customize the functionality and appearance of modules by adding the corresponding tags to each type of module to extend it. 

### Using tags

Tags are used inside Module templates or layouts and represent data associated to an item such as a News headline or Event description.

**Note:** Tags are not transferrable, and cannot be shared across all modules. Use the specific tags listed for each module, in the appropriate layout.

For more details on using tags in layouts, [refer to our getting started article.](http://docs.businesscatalyst.com/content/developer-guides/getting-started/Business-Catalyst-for-developers.html)
