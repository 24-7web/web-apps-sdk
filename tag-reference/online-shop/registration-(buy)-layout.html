<ul>
    <li>This layout contains the HTML code used for the Check Out form. Users get to this form as the final step of the shopping experience after clicking the checkout button outputted by the {<span>tag_buybutton</span>}</code> tag found on the <a href="/reference/tag-reference/online-shop/shopping-cart-layout.html">shopping cart</a> layout.</li>

<h3>Accessible from</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Admin Console:</strong>Â Site Manager &gt; Module Templates &gt; Online Shop Layouts</li>
  <li><strong>SFTP &amp; Develop Mode:</strong>  /Layouts/OnlineShop/order_registration-XX.html
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Replace "XX" with the country code you have added in the Site Settings &gt; Site Domains panel (see the "Country" column).
</p>
<p>
If you have multiple domains with different "Country" values you will find multiple order-registration-XX files, one for each country.
This way, with one layout for every country defined you can vary the contents of the layout to accomodate a multilingual website.
