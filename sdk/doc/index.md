The sdk provides all required tools and components for BC developers who want to develop Open Platform applications. Out of the box, all components
provided by the sdk work on all major browsers and support mobile devices.

## SDK Topology

The SDK provides a set of namespaces which group together classes with similar functionality:

* {@link BCAPI.Components}
* {@link BCAPI.Components.DataSources}
* {@link BCAPI.Components.Validation}
* {@link BCAPI.Models}
* {@link BCAPI.Security}
* {@link BCAPI.Messaging}

## Supported browsers

The current prototype of BC UI SDK supports latest versions of all major browsers. We are actively
testing this on:

* Internet Explorer 11
* Chrome
* Firefox
* Safari
