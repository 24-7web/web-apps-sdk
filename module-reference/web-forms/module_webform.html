<div class="description">
<h3 class="skiptoc">Description</h3>
<p>Displays a single web form on the page that matches the web form ID. Please note that you need to customize the form before you insert it onto the page as a module. One form cannot be inserted as a module and it is the form in eCommerce in the registration layout. The formID parameter should not be changed and it is assigned by module manager. </p>
<p>To insert a webform as a module make sure you have this checkbox checked: <img alt="" src="/kb_resources/screenshots/2013-04-01_1538.png" style="border:0px;  border-image: initial;" /></p>
Inserting a webform as a module instead of the "classic" HTML code is most useful when you have one webform inserted in multiple pages. If you need to make a change you can edit the form's HTML code in a single panel (THe "Customize Web Form" panel - see the screenshot below) as opposed to editing all the pages the form is inserted to.
