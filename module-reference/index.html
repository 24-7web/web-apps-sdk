<h1>Module reference</h1>
        
        <p>Modules are pre-built features that come included with the Business Catalyst Platform.
            Using either the Admin Console, "Develop" mode, or Adobe Dreamweaver, you can insert
            these modules inside web pages to add new features to your sites. Examples of module
            functionality include: forums, blogs, photo galleries, and RSS feeds.</p>
        <p>If your requirements go beyond what a pre-built module offers, you can extend
            the system using Web Apps.</p>
        
        <h2>Using Modules inside Modules</h2>
        
        <p>You have the ability to use modules within modules. This means that for example,
            within a Content Holder you can place one or more of the below modules within it.
            There are some important items to note when doing this:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>There is a 75 maximum module limit on any page rendered by the system. This includes
                modules placed within other modules, for example if you have a Content Holder that
                has a Bookings module rendering within the Content Holder itself, this will count
                as two modules on the page.</li>
            <li>Rendering modules within modules will only render 3 levels deep. For example,
                if you have a recursive Content Holder that contains itself within the content,
                this will render 3 levels before no longer rendering. See below tree-structure
                for an example of inserting this Content Holder on a page:
                <ul>
                    <li>Content Holder 1
                        <ul>
                            <li>Content Holder 2 <em>- LEVEL 1</em>
                                
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Content Holder 3 <em>- LEVEL 2</em>
                                        
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Content Holder 4 <em>- LEVEL 3</em>
                                                
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>Content Holder 5 <em>- WILL NOT RENDER</em>
                                                    </li>
                                                </ul>
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
