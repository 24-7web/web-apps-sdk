## {module_photogallery,ID,rowLength,targetFrame,resultsPerPage,Width,Height,UseStandardMethod}

Renders the specified Photo Gallery as thumbnails, with a lightbox effect.

### Parameters

* `ID` - System generated ID (Do not change this number.)
* `rowLength` - Set the number of photos displayed per row
* `targetFrame` - Set the destination frame where the photos will open (such as _blank)
* `resultsPerPage` - Set the number of photos displayed per page
* `Width/Height` - Set the width and height of the thumbnail images. The default value is 80 pixels wide by 80 pixels high.
* `UseStandardMethod` - Use the standard Thumbnail Generation. Set to False for better thumbnail quality (with increased file size).

**Note:** If an image is 640 pixels wide x 400 pixels high and you set the thumbnail size to 120 x 120 pixels, the thumbnail image will have a maximum width of 120 and a smaller height. Proportions are respected when creating the thumbnail image. 

Alternatively if the image dimensions are 400 pixels wide x 640 pixels high, then the height will be 120 pixels and the width smaller. The thumbnail size dictates the maximum width or the maximum height of the image.

### Example

`{module_photogallery,26800,4,,12,120,120,true}`

Renders 4 photos per row at a maximum of 12 photos per page, with a thumbnail size of 120x120 pixels.
