<h1>Liquid reference</h1>
<h3>Output tags</h3>
<p>Output tags represent information about the page or about the layout. </p>
<p>In a sense they are similar to regular BC tags. Unlike regular tags however, Liquid output tags are wrapped in double curly braces like so:</p>
<pre class="language-markup"><code>
{{<span>name</span>}}
</code></pre>
<p>To see the list of Liquid output tags you can use at any given point you can use the {{<span>this | json</span>}} tag, this basically outputs all the tags that are available on a particular layout, page or template. Take a look at <a href="/developers/beta/getting-started-with-liquid#available_tags">this article</a> for the exact steps on how to use the {{<span>this | json</span>}} tag.</p>
<h3>Logic tags</h3>
<p>Logic tags represent the logic that can be used to manipulate the Liquid tags and markup. You can use FOR loops, IF/CASE statements and so on. Here is the list of block statements you can use and a few examples for each of them.</p>
<h3>Operators</h3>
<p>Operators can be used to compare different variables and output tags. Here is the list of operators.</p>
<h3>Filters</h3>
<p>Filters can be added to output tags in order to manipulate their content. You can perform string-type operations (capitalize, convert to lower case, replace etc), mathematical operations, etc. Take a look at this article for the list of supported filters.</p>
